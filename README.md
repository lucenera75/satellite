 # Satellite
 ## What is
 
 Satellite is a todo list, essentially.
 
 It is designed for fast modifications and to be a companion while developing
 
 It is not specifically a project management tool, it is more oriented to a story managament version
 
 It is a work in progress, still, but I am using it for Satellite work itself.
 
 ## This is how it looks

 ## How it works?
 
 Everytime you add a task you can specify dependencies just by type them
 
 If they don't exists (or you don't choose any suggested one) it will be simply created
 
 The tasks at the top of the list are the ones that the system consider more important and immediately actionable
 
 The graph shows the tasks and their connections. the bigger the ball the more that task is important to free other tasks.
